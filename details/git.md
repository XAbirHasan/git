# What is git?
Git is a powerful version control system that allows developers to keep track of the changes made to their code. It allows developers to collaborate on projects, revert to previous versions of the code, and branch out to experiment with new features without affecting the main codebase.

One of the most important aspects of Git is being able to check the status of your files, including which files have been modified, added, or deleted. Developers can use `git status` command for that. Another important aspect of Git is being able to view the commit history, including when and who made the changes, and what changes were made. Developers can use `git log command` for that.

Git is widely used in software development and has become an industry standard for managing source code. It's also widely used in data science and machine learning projects.

For example, a software development team is working on a project. Each member of the team can clone the repository, make changes to their local copies, and push those changes back to the central repository. This allows the team to work on the project simultaneously without conflicts. Git also allows team members to easily revert to previous versions of the code or branch off to experiment with new features without affecting the main codebase.

In data science, git is useful for versioning the data, code and experiment. For example, as a data scientist, you could use git to version control your Jupyter notebooks and Python scripts, as well as the data you're using for your analysis. This allows you to easily reproduce your results and collaborate with other data scientists on the same project. Additionally, you can use git to version control your machine learning models and experiment with different versions of your model.

In summary, git is a powerful version control system that is widely used in software development and data science to manage source code and other files. It allows developers and data scientists to collaborate on projects, revert to previous versions of the code, and branch out to experiment with new features without affecting the main codebase.
